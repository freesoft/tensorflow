# TensorFlow
These examples are what I've tried while reading "First contact with TensorFlow" so far(especially those with numbers), 
but probably adding some tweaked version of it or my own code as well once I get used to TensorFlow library.
<p/>
At this point, I'm using TensorFlow 1.0.1, which is just released, and there are a few changes different than in the book.

* tensorflow.mul() doesn't exist anymore, use tensorflow.multiply().


More examples are Coming Soon&trade;
